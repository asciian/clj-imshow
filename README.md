# clj-imshow

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/clj-imshow.svg)](https://clojars.org/clj-imshow)

A implementation of OpenCV's imshow. This library supports OpenCV and JavaCV/JavaCPP-Presets. In 2018 `imshow` and `waitKey` doesn't work on macOS, you can use this wrapper.

## Usage

- OpenCV
    ```clojure
    (import [org.opencv.imgcodecs Imgcodecs])
    (require '[clj-imshow.core :as cvx])
    
    (cvx/imshow "lena" (Imgcodecs/imread "lena.png"))
    (cvx/imshow (Imgcodecs/imread "lena.png")) ;; When you give no title, title is "Untitled"

    (cvx/showing?) ;; If window is not showing, then it returns false.
    ```

- JavaCV/JavaCPP-Presets
    ```clojure
    (import [org.bytedeco.javacpp.opencv_imgcodecs])
    (require '[clj-imshow.core :as cvx])
    
    (cvx/imshow "lena" (opencv_imgcodecs/imread "lena.png"))
    (cvx/imshow (opencv_imgcodecs/imread "lena.png")) ;; When you give no title, title is "Untitled"
    (cvx/showing?) ;; If window is not showing, then it returns false.
    ```
